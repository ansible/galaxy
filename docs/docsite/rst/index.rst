About Galaxy
`````````````

Galaxy is a hub for finding and sharing Ansible content.

Use Galaxy to jump-start your automation project with great content from the Ansible community. Galaxy provides
pre-packaged units of work known to Ansible as Roles, and new in Galaxy 3.2, Collections.

Roles can be dropped into Ansible PlayBooks and immediately put to work. You'll find roles for provisioning
infrastructure, deploying applications, and all of the tasks you do everyday. The new Collection format provides
a comprehensive package of automation that may include multiple playbooks, roles, modules, and plugins.

Use Galaxy's Search page to find Roles and Collections for your project, then follow the instructions to
download them onto your Ansible host.

Help other Ansible users by sharing the awesome content you create. Maybe you have a Role for installing and
configuring a popular software package, or a Collection containing a suite of automation for managing hardware
and services from your company. Whatever it is, use Galaxy to share it with the community.
