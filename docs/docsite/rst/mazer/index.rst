Mazer
*****

Mazer is a a new command-line tool for managing `Ansible <https://github.com/ansible/ansible>`_ content, and an open source project
on GitHub at `ansible/mazer <https://github.com/ansible/mazer>`_.

.. note::
    
    Mazer is experimental, and currently only available for tech-preview. Use with lots of caution! It is not intended for use in
    production environments, nor is it currently intended to replace the `ansible-galaxy` command-line tool.

    If you're installing Ansible content in a production environment, or need assistance with Ansible, please visit the `Ansible Project <https://github.com/ansible/ansible>`__,
    or the `Ansible docs site <https://docs.ansible.com>`_.

.. note::
    
    Before installing roles with Mazer, review :ref:`using_mazer_content`. Mazer installs content different from
    the way ``ansible-galaxy`` does.

    Mazer is most useful when used with a version of Ansible that understands mazer installed content.
    Currently that means the `'mazer_role_loader' branch of ansible <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/mazer_role_loader>`_.
    See :ref:`installing_the_companion_branch_of_ansible` for details.
