Deprecating Content
*******************

You can deprecate Collections and Role repositories that you own from the
'My Content' page. To do this, select the Namespace that contains the Collection or
Role, and select the *Deprecate* option in the dropdown menu next to the import button.
Conversely, undeprecate by selecting *Un-Deprecate* from the same dropdown menu.

Deprecated content is marked with the deprecated tag on the Search, My Content,
Author and Content Detail pages. Deprecated content is filtered out of search
results by default. It is still possible to find and use deprecated content by
removing the search filter for 'Deprecated: False' on the search page, however
using deprecated content will result in a warning.
