This topic describes how content is scored.

Content Scoring is in early iterations, to be improved with
user feedback and future additions to ansible-lint.

Overall Score
=============

The overall score is a combination of the community score, the quality score and the number of surveys that have been submitted for a role.
This number is calculated as the weighted average of the community and quality scores. If there are fewer than three surveys submitted the
quality score has a slightly higher weight. If there are three or more surveys submitted the community and quality scores have an identical
weight. For more details on this formula see `PR #1406 <https://github.com/ansible/galaxy/pull/1406>`_.

Community Score
===============

* The Community Score is calculated from community surveys submitted by Galaxy users
  - Each question receives an value of 0 to 5 points based on how the user answers it
  - The total score is a simple average of the value of all of the questions
  - Questions that are unanswered are not included in the average
* Maximum score of ``5.0``

Quality Score
=============

* The Quality Score is based on analysis from ``yamllint`` ``ansible-lint`` and import-time checks
* Maximum score is ``5.0``
* The Quality Score is the average of `Syntax Score <syntax-score_>`_ and `Metadata Score <metadata-score_>`_

.. note::
   Scoring is only done at import, to re-score please re-import

Linters Used
------------

* ``yamllint`` is run with a `custom config <https://github.com/ansible/galaxy/blob/devel/galaxy/importer/linters/yamllint.yaml>`_
* ``ansible-lint`` is run using its default rules, for information on how to fix Ansible Lint issues, see the descriptions in the `default rules <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-lint/rules/default_rules.html>`_
* import-time checks reference the Galaxy database, checking for valid platforms, valid cloud platforms, and loadable dependencies

.. _syntax-score:

Syntax Score
------------
Linter issues applied to the Syntax Score are ``yamllint`` and non-metadata ``ansible-lint``

Each linter issue is subtracted from a max score of ``5.0``:

* Issue severity of "VERY_HIGH" reduces the score by ``1.0``
* Issue severity of "HIGH" reduces the score by ``0.5``
* Issue severity of "MEDIUM" reduces the score by ``0.25``
* Issue severity of "LOW" reduces the score by ``0.125``
* Issue severity of "VERY_LOW" reduces the score by ``0.075``
* Issue severity of "INFO" does not reduce the score

.. _metadata-score:

Metadata Score
--------------
Linter issues applied to the Syntax Score are metadata ``ansible-lint`` and import-time checks

Each linter issue is subtracted from a max score of ``5.0``:

* Issue severity of "VERY_HIGH" reduces the score by ``1.0``
* Issue severity of "HIGH" reduces the score by ``0.5``
* Issue severity of "MEDIUM" reduces the score by ``0.25``
* Issue severity of "LOW" reduces the score by ``0.125``
* Issue severity of "VERY_LOW" reduces the score by ``0.075``
* Issue severity of "INFO" does not reduce the score
